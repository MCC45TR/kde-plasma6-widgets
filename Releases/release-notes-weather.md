## � MWeather v1.1.5 - Small Mode UI Fix
*Released on January 16, 2026*

A quick hotfix to improve text readability in compact layouts.

```

## 🚀 MWeather v1.1.3 - Optimization & Cleanup
*Released on January 16, 2026*

Internal cleanup and final transition to JS-based localization for ultimate reliability.

### 🧹 Improvements
*   **Asset Optimization**: Removed the obsolete `localization.json` file. All translations are now exclusively served via `localization.js`, which prevents any XHR-related loading issues.

### 📦 Installation
```bash
kpackagetool6 -t Plasma/Applet --upgrade com.mcc45tr.mweather-v1.1.3.plasmoid

## 🎨 MWeather v1.1.2 - Layout Polish & JS Localization
*Released on January 16, 2026*

This update finalizes layout adjustments and solves localization loading issues permanently.

### ✨ What's New
*   **Localization Fix**: Switched from JSON/XHR to a pure **JS-based localization** (`localization.js`) method. This bypasses browser/QML file access restrictions, ensuring translations load reliably on all systems.
*   **Layout Polish**: Added subtle spacing (4px) between the header buttons (Details/Daily) and the forecast grid in Large Mode for better visual separation.
*   **Code Cleanup**: Removed obsolete inline fallback logic in favor of the robust JS import method.

### 📦 Installation
```bash
kpackagetool6 -t Plasma/Applet --upgrade com.mcc45tr.mweather-v1.1.2.plasmoid
```
